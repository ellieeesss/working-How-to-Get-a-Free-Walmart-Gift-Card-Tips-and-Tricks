### 3. **Sign Up for Rewards Programs**

Walmart has its own rewards program called "Walmart+," which offers a variety of benefits to members, such as free shipping and discounts.

Just remember, giveaways can be competitive, so enter as many as you can for more chances to win!

### 5. **Complete Special Offers and Tasks**

Websites like MyPoints and FeaturePoints allow users to earn free gift cards by completing special offers and tasks. These tasks may include signing up for free trials, downloading apps, or watching promotional videos. After completing enough tasks, you can redeem your points for Walmart gift cards. These offers are typically quick and easy to complete, making it a simple way to earn rewards while passing time.

### 6. **Sign Up for Walmart’s Email List**

Walmart occasionally sends out email promotions and discounts to customers who subscribe to their mailing list. Occasionally, you might receive a special offer for a free gift card when you make a purchase or complete a specific action. Signing up for Walmart’s email list ensures you’re the first to know about these exclusive deals. Keep an eye on your inbox for potential offers that can help you score a free Walmart gift card!

### 7. **Review Products on Walmart’s Website**

Walmart allows customers to leave reviews on products they've purchased. Occasionally, Walmart runs promotional campaigns where reviewers are rewarded for their feedback. While not all reviews will earn a gift card, some may be eligible for rewards if your review is selected. Make sure your reviews are detailed, helpful, and honest to improve your chances of earning rewards.

### 8. **Referral Programs**

Certain websites and apps offer referral programs that allow you to earn free Walmart gift cards by referring friends and family. By sharing your referral code with others, you can earn points or credits every time someone signs up or makes a purchase. This is a great way to earn multiple free gift cards by simply sharing deals with others.
